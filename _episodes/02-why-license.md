## Learning Objectives

* Understand the role of copyright and licenses in guiding how developers approach contributing to the code and users approach using it.Understand why open-source licenses are popular in scientific software.
* Understand why using existing open-source licenses is preferable to creating new ones.
* Understand what tools are available to help select open-source licenses.
* Understand the necessity and value of clearly documenting the choice of license in your code repository and in the code itself.

## Outline

* Specifying a license provides clarity as to how others can contribute to or use the software.
    * Contributors: How can maintainers use the contributions?  What rights do contributors maintain in their contributions?
    * Users: Interaction with licenses of other software (e.g., an application or tool and its dependencies).  Potential for vendor adoption, commercialization, etc.
    * The choice of license should be treated as a _tool_ for the greater goals of the project and the software.
