## Learning Objectives

* Understand the role of copyright and licenses in guiding how developers approach contributing to the code and users approach using it.
* Understand why open-source licenses are popular in scientific software.
* Understand why using existing open-source licenses is preferable to creating new ones.
* Understand what tools are available to help select open-source licenses.
* Understand the necessity and value of clearly documenting the choice of license in your code repository and in the code itself.

## Outline

* Since 1989 (in the U.S.) creative works, including software, are “born copyrighted”.
    * The owner of the copyright is either the author or (more commonly, in practice) the author’s employer as “work for hire”.
    * Most employment contracts include clauses about intellectual property rights (copyright, patents, trademarks)
    * The default “license” associated with copyright is “all rights reserved” to the holder of the copyright.

## Copyright, Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses

* **Copyright**  grants the creator of an  **original work** exclusive rights to its use and distribution, including limits on derivative works
* A  **patent**  grants the inventor of  **something new, useful, and non-obvious** the rights to its production, use, and distribution
* A  **trademark**  is a  **sign, design, or expression** which identifies products or services from a particular source, as distinguished from other sources
* **Licenses**  are used to transfer (selected) rights in a work, invention, or mark from one party to another
  * Software licenses are mostly about copyright, but can contain clauses on patents and trademarks too

## Your Software Starts Out Copyrighted

* Under the law, the software you write is subject to  **copyright on creation**
  * You don’t have to do anything special to claim copyright
  * Unless you specify some license, all rights are reserved to the owner of the copyright
* The copyright owner may be  **you,** or **your employer**
  * “Work for hire” (i.e., as part of your job) is probably owned by your employer.  Employment contracts often make IP rights explicit.
  * Question 1: Who owns the rights in the work you create?
  * Homework: Find out!
  * If your employer owns the copyright, you probably have to get formal permission to license and distribute your software
* Exception: Works created by the US government cannot be copyrighted
  * They are considered to be in the public domain
    * Comment: Originally to ensure public access to the US legal code

## The Licensing Spectrum

Proprietary or Closed Licenses

Free or Open Licenses

All Rights Reserved

**Free vs Open Source?**

* “Free” in licensing discussions should refer strictly to “freedom” (to do certain things with the software)

* Often gets conflated with “free as in beer”, muddling the discussion.  Hence some prefer term “open source”

**Major names in Free/Open Source Software:**

* Free Software Foundation (FSF) [http://fsf.org/licensing](http://fsf.org/licensing)

* Open Source Initiative (OSI) [http://opensource.org](http://opensource.org/)

*Common misconception: Nothing in the definition of free or open source software prevents you from making money from it! (more later)*
