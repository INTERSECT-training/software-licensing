This lesson provides an introduction to software licensing and related intellectual property issues for developers of scientific software.
It will present common terminology and examples of some of the considerations that might go into choosing a license.

**How you choose to license your software should be viewed as a *tool* to help accomplish your goals for that software.**
There is no universal “right answer”!
And, depending on the circumstances, the answer may not be your decision.
This lesson intends to get you thinking, not to give you answers.
